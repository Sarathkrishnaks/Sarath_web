  A great seaport where Arab, Chinese and East African traders once converged,Kozhikode was the important
   region of the Malabar coast in early days. Vasco da Gama landed on its shores in 1498. <br><br>

  Once the capital of the powerful Zamorins and a prominent trade and commerce centre ,the whiff of history 
  continues to permeate the lanes,bazaars and business hubs and also adding to the legacy of this region is
   a unique culture and warm friendly people. <br><br>
  
  Kappad Beach: [16 km from Kozhikode) This is the historic beach where Vasco da Gama landed on the 27th of 
  May 1498, with 170 men in three vessels. Locally known as Kappakadavu, a monument on the beach commemorates 
  this historic event interesting feature of the landscape is the sprawling rocky headland that protrudes the 
  sea, on which rests an 800-year-old temple. <br><br>
  
  Kadalundl Bird Sanctuary: (19 km from Kozhikode and 7 km from Beypore Port) sanctuary is spread across a 
  cluster of islands in a scenic setting surrounded by hillocks where the Kadalundi River flows into the
  Arabian Sea. Over 100 species of native birds and more than 60 species of migratory birds flock here from
   November to April. A hillock, which stands 200 m above sea level provides a splendid view of the river 
   mouth and the sea. The place is also known for a wide variety of fish, mussels and crabs. The mangrove 
   vegetation shelters otters and jackals too. <br><br>
  
  Kozhikode Beach: A favourite haunt of sunset viewers, it is also a good place for trying out seafood 
  delicacies like kallumekaya [mussels], available at the numerous stalls lining the promenade. At dawn,
   a walk along Dolphin's Point will reward you with a sight of playful dolphins. Adding to its natural 
   beauty is the old world charm retained by the old lighthouse and the two crumbling piers that run into
    the sea, each more than a hundred years old. Entertainment facilities such as the Lions Park for children
     and the marine water aquarium are added attractions. The aquarium is open on all days. <br><br>
  
  SNI Street: Sweet Meat Street or Mithai Theruvu is the busiest street in Kozhikode and derives its name
   from the times when the street was lined with sweet meat [Halwa] stalls. Today the street bustles with 
   shops that sell anything and everything including the famed sweets and banana chips. <br><br>
  
  Beypore Port: Located at t mouth of the Chaliyar River, Beypore was one of the prominent ports and maritime
   trading centres of ancient Kerala. Old-time Beypore was much sought-after by merchants from Western Asia for
    its ship-building industry. The boat building yard here, famous for the construction of the Uru 
    (Arabian trading vessel), boasts a tradition of almost 1,500 years. You can pick up toy boats and exquisite 
    models of boats inside bottles from the many shops on the approach road, as well as from the Kairali Emporium.
